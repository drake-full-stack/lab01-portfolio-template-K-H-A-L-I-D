            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Khalid, a Computer Science and AI student at Drake University who's passionate about technology 
            and problem-solving. I love exploring how different programming languages work and finding creative ways to 
            apply what I learn in class to real-world challenges. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me working 
            on cybersecurity puzzles or diving into a good sci-fi book!</p>

            <h2>What I'm Up To</h2>
            <p>This semester I'm planning to continue working on some cool research projects with professors Manley, Urness and Migunov here at Drake. This past summer I completed a software engineering internship 
            at Dwolla, a fintech company, where I got hands-on experience with Typescript, React, Next.js, and working on production 
            systems. I'm also a founding member of Drake's Cyber Club, which we started Last September, and we actually 
            placed 5th nationally in a major hackathon! Through this web development course, I'm hoping to build 
            projects that combine my interests in AI and Cybersecurity with great user experiences.</p>
